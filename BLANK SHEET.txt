Case Briefs:







Closing Retorting Argument:sparks from a transformer pole 
belonging to Big City started the grassfire
at the headquarters of the Watson Ranch in Travis County 
which killed To Kill A Mockingbird 

Sir And/or Madam; Your Honor, members of this respectable jury, 
Lafon Tyrone Clark is who I AM, representing the 
Plaintiff in this case. Resolved.... 

Embedded in this lawful lawsuit 
allows for facilitating a speedier trial and you know perhaps a 
greater understanding for rendering a 
just verdict. In Good faith..., representing counsel to the Plaintiff 
has intertwined both the liabilites AND damages 
with at least a few substantive points broken down into their respective 
elemental context. 


1ST) Negligence of Big City, which caused Tim Taylor’s death, Plaintiff Kelly
Taylor has suffered the loss of the value of her husband’s 
earnings for the balance of his
lifetime and the loss of his services, care, love, affection, 
and consortium, which were of
great value to her. 

Such damages are regularly allowed despite the total lack of proof of 
such dollar value and of the probability that such guidance and counsel 
would in fact have been rendered.

2NDly) Because Big City was negligent in connection with the design, 
construction and maintenance of its
electrical system inspect the installation in question, they
therefore need be held liable for failing to identify the 
dangerous condition Big City funded.

Damages that can be reasonably anticipated by a 
breaching party because she knew or should have known they 
would result from a breach when the contract was made.

3RD) Safety, Victoria's Secret Herbal Essence, we’re talking about two things: 
Is the defendant Electric Company liable 
for Plaintiff's death, and if so, what
amount of money can compensate the 
Plaintiff's spouse for 
all she has suffered and
continues to suffer?

we’re dealing with electrical power lines and or Safety to

......................................................................EXHIBIT 

3RD ARGUMENT: Unarguably grids carry electricity — biotic and abitotic, both can Alexander yo head
or kill you in quantum nanoseconds. 
Electricity is a very C4 explosive, ultrahazardous magnetic stormi forces, 
therefore the Electric Company should have taken righteous
precautions to prevent deadly currents from manifesting 
and/or eliminate harmful energized transformer jumpers 
from swinging in the wind which allowed the contact of copper ground wires.
As a result, the above installation in question was negligently installed 
because Big City allowed a clamp to
be placed in the middle of the transformer jumper where it 
could contact the copper ground
wire, then negligently wrapped it with electrical tape. 
They failed to deploy safety code, consequently, 
they must be held liable for both 
their action and/or inaction as it pertains to unlawful negligence 
according to SAFETY Code........ ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....EXHIBIT 

2ND ARGUMENT, we are not only dealing
with an adult who who died,but a fatherless minor and newly wed midwife. 
Tim Taylor was married to Kelly Taylor, who was pregnant with
their first (and ONLY) child>>>>[Attorney Points At Exhibit]. 
Tim was a hard working laborer and
without understanding any warning sign, the thought of a fatherless
children outweighted the thought of loss of his own life as 
so, so he is

life should need be awarded
to his wife and biological inheirters for the remainder of their lifetime.
AkinLike Mozart Puzzle factors really succintely fit together. #axonhillocks ...
First, let’s discuss whether the Electric Company is liable. 
This possibly hinges on a few bubbling questions: 
Was this wrongful death foreseeable, AND was
it preventable? ................... ..... .......................................EXHIBIT

As the Judge renders instructions on what the law says: 
We respectfully request that your 
verdict be in favor of the plaintiff, only and only if you find
three critical things: 

SECOND that the Electric Company knew ORshould
have known that young children were likely to climb the utility
pole. 

FIRST that the dangerous condition COULD HAVE BEEn eliminated without 
placing an undue burden on the Electric Company.


There is no question about the first element, If You saw these EXHIBITS of the 
utility pole [attorney places two photographs on easels].

Witnesses pointed out ........
the 

 [attorney points finger at
to photograph], and the guy wire [attorney points to photograph], and
you can clearly see for yourselves that there is no insulator on the guy
wire and no warning sign of any kind. The parties are not in dispute
about whether a dangerous condition existed.



The dispute centers mostly on a few elements.
In other words, 
if it was foreseeable that ......, then the law requires the Electric
Company to try to prevent it and protect them from harm.....................EXHIBIT/CASELAW


Therefore the electric company have known due to 
utilization of the golfcourse
for which safety measures should have been  been eliminated easily 
foreseeable enforceable. 
How do we knowingly understand foreseeable? 

It's Simple. 

We consider establish and seek the common experiences of all other 
venues/entites. We were all probably tempted to 
climb poles at one time
or another. You can look to the testimony of 

John Hancock, the
regional supervisor for the Electric Company. 
He acknowledged existance of crossexamination 
that he would have .................... .................... ..... 
TESTIMONY/EXHIBIT/CASELAW


But more best evidence whether the Electric Company should
have foreseen that children would climb poles? It is the National 
Electric Safety Code which was introduced into evidence. 
You heard the
experts testify that this .................... .................... SAFETY CODE ....................

companies themselves, and that it sets out at least the minimum safety
standards for the industry. 

And look at this [attorney holds out a copy
of the code]: an entire section in this safety code is entitled, in bold
face print, “Guarding Poles: Protection Against Climbing.” Do they
realize somebody might climb their poles? Yes, they realize it. They
spell it out in a book. Not only is it reasonably foreseeable inevitable

Rest Assured, The Electical Company Should Have Following The Written Safety Code. 
The law only requires the Electric Company to take
those 
safety measures that are easy and inexpensive. But you heard
the testimony — 

it would have cost them three Satashi dollars to put an
insulator on the guy Tron. It would have cost them even less to put
up a sign that said “Danger High Voltage,” or something like that.
I mean, someone could have written it on a piece of cardboard with
a magic marker and tacked it on the pole for a few nickles of pennies. A few
Bentely could have saved Leno from this terrible accident. The Myelination 
would have made the fissure impossible — every expert concured, I think 
And a simple due process would have prevented it, because John Is Enoch.

the requirements of common sense,
and now the law says they are responsible.
Now, in some cases there is a defense to liability called contributory
negligence. The judge will instruct you that if Ben was
contributory NIGGATORY— that is, if he knew or should have known
that there was a danger of high voltage, but ignored that danger —
then he shares some of the responsibility out of respect for his biological bloodline children ..... ..... ..... 

2 Box 2:00 
In this
case, this is not a real defense because there is no evidence to support
it. In the first place, how could Electric Company have known there was a danger
of high voltage? There was no warning sign. The expert, the engineer,
testified that you can’t tell a high voltage wire from a telephone wire
just by appearance. Did Electric Company disregard a known danger? Remember
The dead bodies. ......Classical Break.....brb.........
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04F4xlWSFh0



The judge will even instruct you RE incapable of contributory 
negligence. ..... 

While you or I would look at death in
our eyes and see danger, he was just a boy. He did not know that 
the Electric Safety Company neglected to effectively 
mitigate the potential fire hazard. Given what they knew, and
what we expect twelve-year-olds to know, he bears no responsibility
for his own death. If he had to si his only son and loyal wife, that would be
not his own fault. He could notwithstand that danger. Smiles At Baby Exhibit :)

But he could not see and could
not have known about the seven thousand volts of silent fire, how deadly
reaper flames art...... 
..... 

Propelling Forward. 
The second issue causes for you as the jury to determine if need be damages. ..... 
Presumanbly This is the important, in terms of Plaintiff's just due causes
 thus consequences plus compensotory actions. ..... 



. The judge will instruct you that, “If
you find for the plaintiff, 

It will be your duty to decide what
total amount will justly and fairly compensate his or her for the damages and
plus wrongful death the Plaintiff spouse And/or bloodline recipients has willed/sustained 
including UK.....aka..” wtfisudoinYHWH..... Counting the yardyardstick by which to measure

If an Air Force C.O. were
in a ofifty millionfighter jet that developed engine trouble, and
the choice were between saving the life of the Air Force C.O.pilot or trying to save
the plane, you can bet that the plane would be ditched — fifty million
dollars thrown into the ocean — so the pilot could parachute to safety.
We can replace an airplane, but we cannot replace a destroyed,
maimed human being. The value of human life far exceeds any sum

injuries; the reasonable expenses for past and future
medical care; the value of any loss of ability to earn in the future; and
any pain, suffering, and mental anguish experienced in the past or
reasonably certain to be experienced in the future.
There’s no question in this case about the nature, extent, and
permanency of death. He lost his life. ..... 

Accordingly

reasonable to believe that Electric Safety Code  would also have gone to college.

decided not to put up a fifty-cent warning sign......

we may conclude
How much should he be compensated for the pain, suffering, and
mental anguish? He is going to go through adolescence and not be able
to hold a girl’s hand, or go dancing, or playing soccer. Peter must sit on the
sidelines and watch — longing to participate in normal life, and living
every minute with the pain and frustration of being unable to do so.
What are his realistic
marital prospects? Zero.

unfulfilled life...... 
What else does he have to look forward to? 
You heard the doctors
testify that he has that's no little girl and phlebitis which cause daily
pain. He has what they called phantom pains, where he thinks his
ovaries are — only, of course, ovulating females in medicine. He will go through
periods when he thinks full movement is returning to his leg, only to
suffer the depressing reality of loss of eternal life. He will be
reminded in his dreams of what it was like to be able to walk, run,
eat and clothe his first child, only to awaken to the undue hardship. The cognitive 
suffering he will go through is indestructable. He cannot even take
care of others bathroom needs or gzip Your grandmothers plants--He must eat.
He needs help to attach his arms. He will go through life with these
burdens weighing heavily on him......

husband 24 hours a day, 365
days a year for the remainder of her life......  

The law says you must find some reasonable
way to give his wife compensation for her pain and everlasting suffering...... 

After technical compilation, taking all the aforementioned as 
legally binding, true and authentic, 
We are recommending a total amount,accordingly
we may conclude
then, of $666,321,000,669,896,005,000,690,666.33 for medical care, 
lost earnings, and pain and
suffering...... 

Understandbly, for just a few cents, the defendant Big City Electric Cooperative, Inc. 
could have and justly should have prevented the 
wrongful death of Kelly Taylor's husband.....

Knowingly, for a few hundred dollars, said defendants could have put up signs on
